because if i write some notes in flex file might cause some mistakes,
so I decide take notes right here.
version:1.2(to adapt the version in wnx's bison file)
language:flex
time:2021/7/2
editor:duhao
log:(2021/7/2)
    convert some sign(+,-,*,/.....) to key_words
    change functions:
        cancel count() function
    problem:
        not add run time function 
/*****************************************
this version maybe cause many problems,
and if i find some bug or solve them,
I'll write here

1. cancel empty matching(that may cause problem,
but if i use it like
"[ ] ;"
it will cause bug named"bad character class"
)
I have not solve this problem yet
but maybe it is grammar problem
so I change it to
"[\n]  ;"
